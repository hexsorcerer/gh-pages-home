Under construction

Currently working on getting the automation setup to publish when changes are
made. Trying to figure out what permissions the token needs to send a repository
dispatch to the playbook. According to the docs, content:write should be enough?

Update: the automation seems to be working pretty well, working on adding
semantic-release into the mix.
